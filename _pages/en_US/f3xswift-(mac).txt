### Required Reading

This is an add-on section for checking your SD card for errors using F3XSwift.

Depending on the size of your SD card and the speed of your computer, this process can take up to several hours!

This page is for Mac users only. If you are not on Mac, check out the [H2testw (Windows)](h2testw-(windows)) or [F3 (Linux)](f3-(linux)) pages.

F3XSwift is only compatible with macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and above. If you have an older version of macOS, follow [F3X (Mac)](f3x-(mac)) instead.
