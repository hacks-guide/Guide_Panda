## Finalizing Setup

### Unable to enter Rosalina due to broken button(s)

Download this [alternate config.bin](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196635695958196224/733384123003175074/config.bin) and place it in `/luma/`. This will change the Rosalina key combination to (Y) + (B).

### "An exception occurred" after trying to launch Homebrew Launcher via Download Play

There is an issue with your `boot.3dsx` file (it is missing, misplaced, or corrupted). Download the latest release of [the Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/latest) and place `boot.3dsx` on the root of your SD card, replacing any existing file. Make sure you are extracting the ZIP file with any tool other than WinRAR, as it is known to cause issues with 3DS-related files.

### "Scripts directory not found" in GodMode9

You did not copy the `gm9` folder from the GodMode9 `.zip` to the root of your SD card. Download the latest release of [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases/latest) and place the `gm9` folder on the root of your SD card, merging it with the existing one.

### `essentials.exefs` missing from `/gm9/out/`

Your device had custom firmware in the past, so you were not automatically prompted to make a backup. Make a backup manually:

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Press and hold (Start), and while holding (Start), power on your device. This will launch GodMode9
1. Navigate to `[S:] SYSNAND VIRTUAL`
1. Select `essentials.exefs`, then `Copy to 0:/gm9/out/`
1. You should now have `essentials.exefs` in `/gm9/out/`

## Boot-related issues on modded devices

The steps detailed here generally assume that your device has a modern custom firmware setup (boot9strap + Luma3DS 8.0 or greater). If your console is running an older homebrew setup (for example, something based on arm9loaderhax or menuhax), you should update your setup before trying these instructions.

### My device gets stuck on a black screen, and the blue light turns off

There is an issue with your `boot.firm` file (it is missing, misplaced, or corrupted). Download the [latest release of Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest) and place `boot.firm` on the root of your SD card, replacing any existing file. Make sure you are extracting the ZIP file with any tool other than WinRAR, as it is known to cause issues with 3DS-related files.

If you hear a "popping sound", potentially accompanied with the backlight turning on for a split second, there is a hardware issue with your device (such as a disconnected backlight cable). You may be able to get your device to boot by holding it at certain angles.

### My device gets stuck on a black screen, with a static blue light

The steps below can be attempted in any order, but are listed from least to most time-consuming.

1. Power off your device, eject the game cartridge if inserted, power on your device, then wait up to ten minutes. If your device boots within ten minutes, the issue has been fixed and is unlikely to reoccur
1. Rename the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card to `Nintendo 3DS_BACKUP`, then attempt to boot. If your device successfully boots, there is some issue within your `Nintendo 3DS` folder. Try clearing home menu extdata:
	+ Navigate to `/Nintendo 3DS/<ID0>/<ID1>/extdata/00000000/`
	+ Delete the extdata file corresponding to your region: 
		+ **EUR Region**: `00000098`
		+ **JPN Region**: `00000082`
		+ **USA Region**: `0000008f`
		+ **CHN Region**: `000000A1`
		+ **KOR Region**: `000000A9`
		+ **TWN Region**: `000000B1`
1. Ensure that your device does not have ARM11 exception handlers disabled:
	+ Power off your device
	+ Hold (Select)
	+ Power on your device, while still holding (Select)
	+ If the "Disable ARM11 exception handlers" box is checked, uncheck it
	+ If your device now boots to the "An exception occured" screen, follow [My device boots to an error screen](troubleshooting#my-device-boots-to-an-error-screen)
1. Try booting into recovery mode and updating your system:
	+ Power off your device
	+ Hold (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A)
	+ Power on your device
	+ If you were successful, the device will boot to an "update your system" screen
1. Follow the [CTRTransfer](ctrtransfer) guide

### My device boots to an error screen

#### "An error has occurred: Failed to apply 1 FIRM patch(es)" or "An exception has occurred -- Current process: pm"

Your Luma3DS version is outdated. Download the latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest) and place `boot.firm` on the root of your SD card, replacing any existing file. Make sure you are extracting the ZIP file with any tool other than WinRAR, as it is known to cause issues with 3DS-related files.

#### "An error has occurred. Hold down the POWER button to turn off the power..."

ARM11 exception handlers are disabled, or custom firmware is not installed. Try enabling ARM11 exception handlers:
	+ Power off your device
	+ Hold (Select)
	+ Power on your device, while still holding (Select)
	+ If the "Disable ARM11 exception handlers" box is checked, uncheck it

#### Some other error

Please take a photo of the error and join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

### Blue "Bootrom Error" screen

Your device is likely hard-bricked. You will need to buy an ntrboot flashcart to reinstall boot9strap in order to attempt to fix your device. This may also indicate a hardware issue which cannot be fixed. In any case, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.
  + It is also possible that someone has set a boot-time splash screen that just looks like a brick. Try leaving your device powered on, waiting on the blue screen, for five minutes.
