### Required Reading

This is an add-on section for formatting an SD card to work with the 3DS.

If the 3DS already recognizes the SD card, this guide is not required.

This page is for Mac users only. If you are not on Mac, check out the [Formatting SD (Windows)](formatting-sd-(windows)) or [Formatting SD (Linux)](formatting-sd-(linux)) pages.
