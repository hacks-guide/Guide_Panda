### Required Reading

The file `boot.firm` is what is launched by boot9strap itself after it finishes loading off of NAND, and can be any valid arm9 payload in the FIRM format. This file can be replaced at any time, although Luma3DS allows for the launch of other arm9 payloads in the FIRM format using the Luma3DS chainloader.

In this case, we use Luma3DS by [LumaTeam](https://github.com/LumaTeam/) to boot a patched SysNAND directly, allowing us to completely bypass the need for any kind of EmuNAND, vastly simplifying the usage of a hacked 3DS in addition to saving SD card space.

During this process, we also setup programs such as the following:

+  **FBI** *(installs CIA formatted games and applications)*
+  **Anemone3DS** *(installs custom themes)*
+  **Checkpoint** *(backs up and restores save files for 3DS and DS games)*
+  **Universal-Updater** *(a homebrew app store for downloading homebrew from the 3DS over wifi)*
+  **GodMode9** *(multipurpose tool which can do NAND and cartridge functions)*
+  **Homebrew Launcher Loader** *(launches the Homebrew Launcher)*
+  **DSP1** *(allows homebrew applications to have sound)*
+  **ctr-no-timeoffset** *(removes the rtc offset so that the home menu and rtc timestamps match)*

If you would like to upgrade to a bigger sized SD card, all you have to do is format your new SD card as FAT32 and copy paste the contents of the old SD card onto the new SD card.

If your new SD card is bigger than 32GB, then you have to use a different tool to format it, such as [guiformat (Windows)](formatting-sd-(windows)), [Disk Utility (Mac)](formatting-sd-(mac)), or [cfdisk (Linux)](formatting-sd-(linux)).
